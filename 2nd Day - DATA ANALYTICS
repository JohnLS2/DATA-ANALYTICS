Whats the real difference? 
Aritificial Intelligence (AI): The big picture (Grand Vision)
- The goal to make machines learn the humans

Machine Learning (ML): The engine that powers AI
- A subset of AI where systems learns patterns from data,

Data Science (DS): The translator
- The practice of turning raw data into meaningful insights

How they work?
AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS) learn by analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns, improve predictions, 
and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. ML models use algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) 
to train on data, while Data Science preps this data to inform models.
